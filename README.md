# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
### Background
Louise is an up and coming playwright looking to create a campaign to fund her upcoming project, a play called "Fever". She has asked for assistance to understand how Kickstarter campaigns work and what are key factors associated with successful campaigns. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this projet is to use excel to analyze a dataset that contains more than 4,000 crowdfunding projects and to identify trends among successful and failed ventures. Ultimately, based on this analysis with excel, we want to be able to give recommendations to Louise on how she could set up her own campaign based on previous examples to make sure it is successful.
